\subsection{Points to Hammer}

\begin{enumerate}
\item a special kind of self composition, where correlated steps are kept together. This is particularly important when handling loops. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{TODO}
\begin{enumerate}
\item show me an example of where comparing abstract values at the end is not sound (e.g., we had some example with intervals that demonstrates this). 
\end{enumerate}

   
\subsection{Questions}

\begin{enumerate}
\item how come you don't need the ``product program''? 
\item what are the theorems that you provide? (no reason to have definitions if there are no theorems).
\item what abstract domains can we use as ``underlying domains'' for our abstraction? Do we have any particular requirements from the abstract domains (one requirement is being relational). 
\item what makes a ``patched version of a program'' different from just saying ``a different program''? In other words - what are the requirements on the difference between $P$ and $P'$?
\end{enumerate}
