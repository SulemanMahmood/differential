This work presented an abstract interpretation approach for program equivalence and differencing. We defined a correlating program construct, a reduction of the the product program, that allowed mutual reasoning and establishing of equivalence. For the purpose of this mutual analysis, we defined a partially disjunctive correlating abstract domain, that allowed us to over approximate variable relationships along paths according to equivalence criteria. We also defined a widening operator which over approximates looping paths correctly. We showed that this approach is feasible and can be applied successfully to challenging real world patches.
