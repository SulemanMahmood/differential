This work presented an abstract interpretation approach for program equivalence and differencing. We defined a correlating program construct, that allowed reasoning over both programs and establishing of equivalence. For the purpose of a mutual analysis, we defined a correlating abstract domain, that allowed us to maintain variable relationships. This partially disjunctive domain allowed us to differentiate equivalent from differencing paths and we introduces a dynamic partitioning strategy to abstract together paths according to equivalence criteria and avoid exponential blowup. We also defined a widening operator for the disjunctive domain, which over approximates looping paths and is able to maintain equivalences for programs with unbound loops, this was not generally possible before. We showed that this approach is feasible and can be applied successfully to challenging real world patches.
