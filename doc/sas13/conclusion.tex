We presented an abstract interpretation approach for program equivalence and differencing. We defined a correlating program construct, that allows reasoning over both programs and establishing of equivalence. We defined a correlating abstract domain, that allows us to maintain variable relationships. This partially disjunctive domain allows to differentiate equivalent from differencing paths and we introduce a dynamic partitioning strategy to abstract together paths according to equivalence criteria and avoid exponential blowup. We also defined a widening operator for the disjunctive domain, which over approximates looping paths and is able to maintain equivalences for programs with unbound loops. We showed that this approach is feasible and can be applied successfully to challenging real world patches.
