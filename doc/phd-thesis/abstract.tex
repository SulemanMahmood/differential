Studying the evolution of software is an emerging topic, receiving much attention and focus as every line of code written today is more likely to belong to an existing piece of software. Identifying and modeling the semantic impact of these patches, in a sound and precise way is a paramount task yet to be fulfilled. Our work is an effort at generating sound, precise and scalable analysis methods for modeling the difference between program versions.
