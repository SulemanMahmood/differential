-------------

- From the Ubuntu software center, search for lib{gmp,mpfr,ppl} and install the *-dev packages (any version tha shows up there should work)
- Get the **latest** version of APRON from svn (sometimes the repository is not very responsive, try a different connection).
- Configure the Makefile.Config apron file to compile the C++ frontend, build and make install 
- Get LLVM 3.0 and CLang. Copy over the DataflowSolver.h file. Build and make install
- Build {idizy,cdizy,ccc,all}
